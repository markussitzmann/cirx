QSAR models for inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were built using GUSAR. The data set
for model building consisted of 3309 compounds with –log10(IC<sub>50</sub>) values obtained from the
NIAID database [1]. 2647 compounds were used as the training set and 662 were used as the test set.
The models were developed using the Multilevel and Quantitative Neighborhoods of Atoms descriptors [2,3]
and Radial Basis Function Self-Consistent Regression. The total number of models was 6: 3 MNA-based
models and 3 QNA-based models. The consensus model was
validated with the test set of 662 compounds, for which it achieved R<sup>2</sup> = 0.67 and RMSE = 0.737.
